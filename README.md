### What Goes into a README?

This README should serve as a template for your own- go through the important
files in your project and describe what they do. Each file that you edit
(you can ignore your Alembic files) should get at least a paragraph. Each
function should get a small blurb.

You should descibe your actual CLI script first, and with a good level of
detail. The rest should be ordered by importance to the user. (Probably
functions next, then models.)

Screenshots and links to resources that you used throughout are also useful to
users and collaborators, but a little more syntactically complicated. Only add
these in if you're feeling comfortable with Markdown.
